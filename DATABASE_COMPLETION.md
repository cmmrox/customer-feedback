   - Create proper user with limited permissions
   
2. Environment Configuration
   - Create .env file with real database credentials
   
3. Migration Execution
   - Run Prisma migrations to create database tables
   - Run seed script to populate initial data
   
4. Database Testing
   - Test database connections
   - Verify all relationships work correctly
   - Check that queries perform optimally

## Commands to Run

Once the database is created and .env file is configured:

```bash
# Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate

# Create and apply migrations
npx prisma migrate dev --name init

# Seed database with test data
npx prisma db seed

# View database with Prisma Studio
npx prisma studio
```
