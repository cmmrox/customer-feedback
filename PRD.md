# Product Requirements Document: Customer Satisfaction Feedback System

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This document outlines the requirements for a web-based Customer Satisfaction Feedback System designed to collect and analyze customer feedback for retail shops. The system will provide an intuitive interface for customers to select the staff members they interacted with and a comprehensive admin portal for management and reporting.

### 1.2 Scope

The application consists of two main components:

- A customer-facing feedback portal
- An administrative management portal with analytics


### 1.3 Definitions

- **Feedback**: Customer selection of staff and comments about their shopping experience
- **Staff**: Shop employees who serve customers and can be selected in feedback
- **Admin**: Users with privileges to manage the system and view reports


## 2. Product Overview

### 2.1 Product Vision

To provide shops with a user-friendly digital platform that captures customer satisfaction metrics in real-time, enabling data-driven improvements to customer service and staff performance.

### 2.2 Target Users

- **Customers**: People who shop at the retail location
- **Administrators**: Shop managers who need to monitor customer satisfaction and manage staff


## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Customer Feedback Portal

#### 3.1.1 Initial Experience Rating

- Users can select either "Good" or "Not Satisfied" to rate their overall shopping experience
- Simple, prominent buttons with clear visual distinction

#### 3.1.3 Negative Feedback Flow

- If "Not Satisfied" is selected, display a selection of common reasons for dissatisfaction
- User can select one or multiple reasons
- Include an optional text field for additional comments
- Upon submission, redirect to the "Thank You" page


#### 3.1.4 Session Timeout

- After the initial screen, if no user interaction is detected for 10 seconds on any subsequent screen, the application automatically resets to the first page
- Timer starts when page loads
- Any user interaction (click, touch) resets the timer


#### 3.1.5 Thank You Page

- Displays a confirmation message thanking the user for their feedback
- Provides a visual indication that the feedback has been recorded
- Automatically redirects to the home screen after a brief display period (5 seconds)


### 3.2 Admin Portal

#### 3.2.1 Authentication

- Secure login system with username/password
- Session management with proper timeout
- Password reset functionality


#### 3.2.2 Staff Management

- Add new staff members with:
    - Name
    - Profile picture upload
    - Position/role
    - Contact information
- Edit existing staff details
- Disable staff (make inactive without removing from system)
- Delete staff (with appropriate confirmation)
- Bulk import/export staff data via CSV


#### 3.2.3 Reporting and Analytics

- Monthly staff interaction reports showing:
    - Total number of times each staff member was selected by customers
    - Comparison between staff members
    - Trends over time with graphical representation
- Dissatisfaction reports showing:
    - Total count of "Not Satisfied" feedback per month
    - Breakdown by reason categories
    - Frequency analysis of recurring issues
- Export reports in PDF and Excel formats


#### 3.2.4 System Configuration
